# Troubleshooting

### YAML Syntax Errors

**Unquoted special characters**: Strings containing `:`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `?`, `|`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `` ! ``, `%`, `@`, `` ` `` must be quoted.

```yaml
# WRONG - colon in unquoted string
displayName: Status: Active

# CORRECT
displayName: "Status: Active"
```

**Mismatched quotes in formulas**: When a formula contains double quotes, wrap the entire formula in single quotes.

```yaml
# WRONG - double quotes inside double quotes
formulas:
  label: "if(done, "Yes", "No")"

# CORRECT - single quotes wrapping double quotes
formulas:
  label: 'if(done, "Yes", "No")'
```

### Common Formula Errors

**Duration math without field access**: Subtracting dates returns a Duration, not a number. Always access `.days`, `.hours`, etc.

```yaml
# WRONG - Duration is not a number
"(now() - file.ctime).round(0)"

# CORRECT - access .days first, then round
"(now() - file.ctime).days.round(0)"
```

**Missing null checks**: Properties may not exist on all notes. Use `if()` to guard.

```yaml
# WRONG - crashes if due_date is empty
"(date(due_date) - today()).days"

# CORRECT - guard with if()
'if(due_date, (date(due_date) - today()).days, "")'
```

**Referencing undefined formulas**: Ensure every `formula.X` in `order` or `properties` has a matching entry in `formulas`.

```yaml
# This will fail silently if 'total' is not defined in formulas
order:
  - formula.total

# Fix: define it
formulas:
  total: "price * quantity"
```

**Circular formulas**: a formula may read another formula, but a cycle (`a` reads `b`, `b` reads `a`) has no value to compute. Break the cycle instead of adding a guard.

### An Empty or Unexpected View Is a Result, Not a Syntax Error

A base that parses and still shows nothing usually has a working filter and a wrong expectation: a property spelled differently in frontmatter, a value that is a string where the filter compares a number, notes outside the folder the filter names, or an index that has not caught up. Diagnose it as a data and runtime question. Do not "fix" it by loosening the schema, deleting filters, or rewriting the file until something appears. [operations.md](operations.md) has the triage order.
